if same varibale is repeatedly inherting we use the virtual keyword
but if same function repeats then use 

void greet(){
    base1 :: greet();
}

virtual functions are used in the base pointers are ponted to the derived class
and virtual keyword should be used if the function should not run from a
particular class

here if we derive an array in the class by the new keyword then
the syntax will be changed and for even in the case like

CWH *ptr[2];// this is different;

and remaing all cases we can use happily ptr[i]; or *(ptr+i)

the new keyword deriving of pointer shall be used only when the class
should not contain constructor
